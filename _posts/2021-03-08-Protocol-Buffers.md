## What is Protocol Buffers and WHY ?

Before diving into deep let me try to summarise what we will be learning going through the post.
- What is serialization and deserialization ? 
- What matters and how to choose between different serialization formats available.
- Why do we even want to use Protocal Buffers, its importance by comparing to two other popular formats which are JSON and XML. 
- Pros and Cons of JSON, XML and PROTOCOL BUFFERS.
- Various tradeoffs between different serialization format.

### What is serialization and deserialization

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
